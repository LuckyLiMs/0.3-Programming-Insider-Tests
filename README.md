This is the prototipe of a series of tests and tutorials that I followed and made a bunch of tests to learn the basics of PHP by researching and doing prototipes of sites based on ecommerces, and this repository also have the root file that its not modified by me, that was made by the instructions followed based on my researches. This prototipes also have an very simple implementation of an basic Data Base that also saves images files by their file path on a varchar column, this Data Base connection is just for learning proposes.
